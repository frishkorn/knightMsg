DESCRIPTION

This script will take user input, convert it to a Straddling Checkerboard cipher, and apply a user selected key to encrypt the message. To decrypt message just enter in message and key. The pencil and paper version uses # symbols to denote the start and end of a sequence of numbers. This script is also compatible with the pencil and paper version of the cipher.
